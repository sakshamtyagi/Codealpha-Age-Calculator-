# Codealpha-Age-Calculator-
Age Calculator Web Application - My first task as a Web Development Intern at CodeAlpha. This tool lets users calculate their age in years, months, and days using their birthdate. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a responsive, user-friendly design. Perfect for personal use, event planning, and more.
